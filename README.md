# Stacks

Stacks is a simple puzzle game to rearrange the pieces of the same kind in a horizontal row.

After rearranging, all the stacks will be in the same order of the pieces.

The order of the pieces is not a fixed order, so it may be different depending on the problem.

If it is arranged within the limit of moves, the problem is cleared.

This game is playable in mobile and desktop browser.
